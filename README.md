# horiseon-refactor
BOOTCAMP - Week 1 homework assignment

<!-- * Repository contains quality README file with screenshot, and link to deployed application. -->

## Description

This homework required the code to be refactored, where required, to improve both semantics of the 
html & accessability of the website.  Comments have been added wherever changes were made to explain 
why these are improvements to the original code. 

## User Story

```
AS A marketing agency
I WANT a codebase that follows accessibility standards
SO THAT our own site is optimized for search engines
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title
```
